# Prac04 - interupts and timer events

We will add an interrupt generated by a timer to invoke the  highwater mark printout to the serial console. Recall that the earlier code ran the task once 5 seconds after the start of execution to give us a snapshot of the memory usage by each task.

Now we will modify it to run every 10 seconds so we can see if the memory requirement changes over time.

We will utilize a FreeRTOS function called **xTimerCreate** to  set up a time; the arguments passed to the *xTimerCreate* function include:

- descriptive name for the timer (text)
- number of ticks between timer events (10000 ms)
- repeat indicator (if set to pdFALSE it only triggers one time)
- timer ID (not used here)
- callback function to execute when a timer event occurs

The *xTimerStart* functions accepts arguments for the timer handle name and the time to wait for the timer queue to be available.
